# Rakshit-Chaurasia-Intro-to-LangGraph--MAT496
This repository will include each and every detail of what I have learned and self reflected throughout my journey of learning  Langgraph from basic .

## Learnings of Video 1
I learned that LangGraph helps language models work better by giving them control flow and access to tools or extra information like documentation.
It solves the limits of normal LLMs and makes their process smoother and safer.
Overall, it helps manage and connect chains and agents so the model works clearly and efficiently.
### (Since the video talks about the general info about LangGraph we haven't uplaoded any file or done any changes as it is just teaching us the basics)


# Beginning of Video 2 for Foundation: Introduction to LangGraph

## Learnings of Video 2
### What have I learned through the Video 2 ?
Well ! I learned how to make a simple graph with the nodes and edges and how to control which path it takes using the conditions.
I also saw how the state changes as the graph moves from one node to the another.

### What were some of the changes that I made different than what was given ?
Earlier in the original file, the graph only had three nodes and randomly chose between happy or sad. So, to change that I added more nodes like the node_4 saying “but!” and the node_9 saying “well” to make it longer and more interesting. Further I added a new function to choose between more paths and made the final output fixed as “Hi, this is Lance. I am excited for the party.” I also cleared the code and added comments such that it’s easier to understand and comprehend.

### Below I am attaching the link to the Updated code file for the video 2 .
