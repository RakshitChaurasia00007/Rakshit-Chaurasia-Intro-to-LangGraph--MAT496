# Rakshit-Chaurasia-Intro-to-LangGraph--MAT496
This repository will include each and every detail of what I have learned and self reflected throughout my journey of learning  Langgraph from basic .

## Learnings of Video 1
I learned that LangGraph helps language models work better by giving them control flow and access to tools or extra information like documentation.
It solves the limits of normal LLMs and makes their process smoother and safer.
Overall, it helps manage and connect chains and agents so the model works clearly and efficiently.
### (Since video talks general info about LangGraph we haven't done any change for it)
